lotus is the worldâ€™s first block chain to utilize the revolutionary new consensus algorithm Proof of Space and Time (PoST) AND recycled crypto resources, allowing it to be farmed on existing Chia plots

Python 3.7+ is required. Make sure your default python version is >=3.7
by typing `python3`.

# If you get RELEASE.dev0 then delete the package-lock.json in lotus-blockchain-gui and install.sh again

git status

# git status should say "nothing to commit, working tree clean", 
# if you have uncommitted changes, RELEASE.dev0 will be reported.

sh install.sh

. ./activate

lotus init

# The GUI requires you have Ubuntu Desktop or a similar windowing system installed.
# You can not install and run the GUI as root

#### Troubleshooting

Sometimes stray daemons left over from previously running processes will cause strange bugs/errors when upgrading to a new version. Make sure all daemons and lotus processes are killed before installing or upgrading.

This is normally done by executing lotus stop -d all from the upgrade example above.
But it doesn't hurt to double check using ps -Af | grep lotus to make sure there are no lotus processes left running. You may have to manually kill the lotus daemon if an install and lotus start was performed without first running lotus stop -d all

If all else fails, rebooting the machine and restarting the lotus daemon/processes usually does the trick.
